Wiggle
======

Wiggle your panes around.

Commands
======
`super+m`, `super+arrow`: Push pane in given direction(ie expand)
`super+m`, `arrow`: Pull pane in given direction(ie shrink)

TODO
======
Quick shortcuts for speedy things(ie, 50%)
Keep other panes sized proportionally(currently just removes space from neighbor)
Make sure that pane does not fully overlap another(ie, a row of `[0.0,0.2,0.3,1.0]`->`[0.0,0.5,0.3,1.0]`) and instead will shift others to make room(ie row `[0.0,0.2,0.3,1.0]`->`[0.0,0.2,0.5,0.6,1.0]`)
